- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marsh
- 👀 I’m interested in basic development. I want to start small, work my way to bigger tasks as I master each area of developing scripts and such. Mostly for FiveM on QBCore.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. I can configure scripts such as those that jimathy produces. IE, mining, mechanic, shops, etc. I am starting to work on MLO configuring. With that, I have only gotten as far as object placement. All in all, I am on the basics, things anyone can learn, but I feel thats where the start truly is. I want to master the basics before I move on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. If you have small things such as what I have described, I would love to take those small stresses off of you so you can worry about the major development. All I ask in return, is the opportunity to learn more. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached easiest on discord at MarshMaui#2587
